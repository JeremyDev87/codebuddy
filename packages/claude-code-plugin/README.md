## MCP Integration (Required)

This plugin requires the CodingBuddy MCP server for full functionality:

```bash
npm install -g codingbuddy
```

The MCP server provides:
- Agents, commands, and skills from `packages/rules/.ai-rules/` (single source of truth)
- Checklists and specialist agent recommendations
- Context management for PLAN/ACT/EVAL workflow

## Architecture

```
packages/rules/.ai-rules/     ← Single source of truth (agents, skills, rules)
        ↓ (MCP protocol)
packages/claude-code-plugin/  ← Thin plugin (manifest + MCP configuration)
```

This architecture ensures:
- **No duplication**: All definitions live in one place
- **DRY principle**: Changes only need to be made once
- **Single source of truth**: `packages/rules/.ai-rules/` is the canonical source
