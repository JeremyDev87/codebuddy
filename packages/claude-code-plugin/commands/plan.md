# PLAN Mode

## Purpose
Design implementation approach before writing code

## Activation
This command activates PLAN mode for the CodingBuddy workflow.

## Instructions

**Important:**
- PLAN mode is the default starting mode
- PLAN mode creates actionable implementation plans following TDD and augmented coding principles
- After creating plan, user can type `ACT` to execute

**🔴 Agent Activation (STRICT):**
- When in PLAN mode, **Frontend Developer Agent** (`.ai-rules/agents/frontend-developer.json`) **MUST** be automatically activated
- The Agent's workflow framework and all mandatory requirements MUST be followed
- See `.ai-rules/agents/frontend-developer.json` for complete development framework

**Purpose:**
Create actionable implementation plans following TDD and augmented coding principles

---

### Clarification Phase (Optional)

**Purpose:**
Resolve ambiguous requirements through sequential Q&A before creating a plan.

**Trigger Condition:**
- AI assesses user request for ambiguity
- If unclear scope, constraints, priority, or expected behavior detected → Start Clarification Phase
- If requirements are already clear → Skip directly to Plan creation

**Phase Rules:**
1. **Single Question Rule** - Ask only ONE question per message
2. **Progress Indicator** - Display "Question N/M" format (estimate M, adjust as needed)
3. **Multiple-Choice First** - Provide A/B/C options whenever possible
4. **Custom Input Allowed** - Always allow "Other" option for user's own input
5. **Language Setting** - Follow agent's `communication.language` setting; if not set, detect from user's input language

**Question Flow:**
1. Analyze request → Identify ambiguous points → Estimate question count
2. Present Question 1/N (multiple-choice format)
3. Wait for user response
4. Continue until all clarifications complete
5. Summarize all collected information in a table
6. Get user confirmation ("Yes" / request modification)
7. Proceed to Plan creation with clarified requirements

**Skip Conditions:**
- User explicitly requests to skip: "Skip clarification" or "Just create the plan"
- Requirements are detailed and unambiguous
- User provides comprehensive specification document

**Reference:**
See `.ai-rules/rules/clarification-guide.md` for detailed question guidelines.

**What PLAN does (with Primary Developer Agent):**

1. **Analyze Requirements** (via Primary Developer Agent)
   - Understand user requirements
   - Identify core logic vs presentation components
   - Determine TDD (test-first) vs Test-After approach
   - 🔴 **Required**: Follow Primary Developer Agent's workflow framework

2. **Plan Implementation** (via Primary Developer Agent workflow)
   - 🔴 TDD for core logic (business logic, utilities, data access layers)
   - 🔴 Test-After for presentation (UI components, views)
   - Define file structure (types, constants, utils)
   - Plan test strategy
   - Consider framework-specific component patterns
   - 🔴 **Required**: Reference Planning Specialist Agents for comprehensive planning (Architecture, Test Strategy, Performance, Security, Accessibility, SEO, Design System, Documentation, Code Quality)

3. **Output Structured PLAN** (via Primary Developer Agent)
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - Clear task breakdown
   - File naming conventions
   - Test coverage goals (90%+)
   - Type safety requirements
   - 🔴 **Required**: Create todo list using `todo_write` tool for all implementation steps

**Output Format (via Primary Developer Agent):**
```

## MCP Integration

If CodingBuddy MCP server is available, call:
```
parse_mode({ prompt: "PLAN: <user request>" })
```

This provides additional context, checklists, and specialist agent recommendations.
