# PR Review

## Overview

Systematic, evidence-based pull request review with anti-sycophancy principles. Critique-first ordering ensures critical issues are identified before any positive observations.

**Core principle:** Review what changed, not what it's called. Labels lie. Tests verify author's assumptions—review catches flawed assumptions.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of code review.**

## When to Use

**Always use for:**
- New feature PRs
- Bug fix PRs
- Refactoring PRs
- Security-related changes
- API changes
- Database schema changes

**Lighter review acceptable for:**
- Documentation-only changes
- Configuration tweaks (still check security)
- Dependency updates (still check security + breaking changes)

**Never skip:**
- Security Quick Scan (4 critical items, ~2 min)

## The Iron Law

```
NO APPROVAL WITHOUT COMPLETING ALL CRITICAL DIMENSIONS
```

Security, Correctness, and Test Coverage must ALWAYS be reviewed. No exceptions.

- Urgency doesn't reduce risk. Hotfix = MORE likely to introduce bugs.
- Trust is not a checklist substitute. Everyone makes mistakes.
- Tests passing ≠ logic correct. Tests verify author assumptions.

## Quick Reference

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Action | Dimensions |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Critical** | Must complete ALWAYS | Correctness, Security, Tests |
| **High** | Must complete for non-trivial PRs | Architecture, Code Quality |
| **Medium** | Complete based on change type | Performance, Accessibility |
| **Low** | Complete if time permits | Documentation |

### Production Blockers (Auto-Reject)

| Issue | Why It Blocks |
|-------|---------------|
| Hardcoded secrets | Security vulnerability |
| SQL injection possible | Data breach risk |
| Missing auth on protected route | Unauthorized access |
| No tests for new code | Regression risk |
| Critical security issue | Production incident |

### Approval Decision Matrix

| Finding | Decision |
|---------|----------|
| Any Critical issue | **Request Changes** |
| Multiple High issues | **Request Changes** |
| Only Medium/Low issues | **Approve with Comments** |
| No issues, all Critical dimensions reviewed | **Approve** |

## Review Efficiency Framework

Efficient reviews are thorough reviews. Time pressure causes shortcuts that miss issues.

### Time-Boxing Guidelines

| PR Size | Target Time | Max Time | If Exceeded |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| XS (1-10 lines) | 5-10 min | 15 min | Document blockers |
| S (11-50 lines) | 15-30 min | 45 min | Request clarification |
| M (51-200 lines) | 30-60 min | 90 min | Split focus areas |
| L (201-500 lines) | 60-120 min | 180 min | Request smaller PR |
| XL (500+ lines) | **Request split** | - | Don't review as-is |

**Time exceeded?** You're either:
1. Missing context → Ask author before continuing
2. Finding too many issues → Request changes early, don't exhaust yourself
3. Scope creeping → Stay focused on what changed, not what could be better

### Efficiency Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Wastes Time | Instead |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Reviewing file-by-file | Misses cross-file relationships | Review by logical change |
| Style nitpicking first | Depletes attention on low-value | Critical dimensions first |
| Rewriting in comments | You're doing their work | Describe what's wrong; brief suggestions OK (see Constructive Feedback) |
| Reviewing draft PRs | Premature feedback changes | Wait for "Ready for Review" |
| Multiple review passes | Tiring for both parties | One thorough pass |

### When to Request Smaller PRs

**Immediately request split if:**
- 500+ lines changed (excluding generated files)
- Multiple unrelated features bundled
- "While I was here..." changes included
- You can't hold the full change in your head

**How to request:**
> This PR combines [X] and [Y]. Could you split into separate PRs? Review will be faster and more thorough for each.

## Change-Type Quick Guides

Different PR types require different focus areas. Use these guides to prioritize your review.

### Feature PRs

| Focus | Why | Key Checks |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Requirements alignment | New code must solve the right problem | Does implementation match ticket/spec? |
| API design | New interfaces are hard to change | Clean contracts? Versioning considered? |
| Test coverage | New behavior needs verification | Happy path + edge cases + errors tested? |
| Performance baseline | New features set expectations | Acceptable load? Indexed queries? |

**Time allocation:** 40% correctness, 30% architecture, 20% tests, 10% docs

### Bug Fix PRs

| Focus | Why | Key Checks |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Root cause | Fixes that mask problems return | Does fix address cause, not symptom? |
| Regression test | Same bug shouldn't reappear | Test proves bug existed AND is fixed? |
| Related code | Similar bugs often cluster | Other code with same pattern? |
| Minimal change | Bug fixes shouldn't refactor | Only changes necessary for fix? |

**Time allocation:** 50% correctness, 30% tests, 15% impact radius, 5% docs

### Refactoring PRs

| Focus | Why | Key Checks |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Behavior preservation | Refactoring ≠ new behavior | Tests unchanged? Same inputs → same outputs? |
| Incremental steps | Big refactors hide bugs | Each commit independently valid? |
| No feature creep | "While I'm here..." is a trap | Scope matches stated goal? |
| Test coverage before/after | Can't verify what you can't test | Coverage same or better? |

**Time allocation:** 50% behavior preservation, 30% architecture, 15% tests, 5% docs

### Dependency Update PRs

| Focus | Why | Key Checks |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Security advisories | Main reason for updates | CVE addressed? New vulnerabilities? |
| Breaking changes | Changelog often buried | Migration guide followed? |
| Transitive deps | Your dep's deps matter | Lock file changes reviewed? |
| Build verification | Updates can break builds | CI passing? Bundle size acceptable? |

**Time allocation:** 40% security, 30% breaking changes, 20% build verification, 10% changelog

### API Change PRs

| Focus | Why | Key Checks |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Contract compatibility | Callers depend on stable interfaces | Backward compatible? Deprecation path? |
| Versioning strategy | Breaking changes need coordination | Version bump appropriate? |
| Documentation | API users need to know what changed | Changelog updated? Migration guide? |
| Consumer impact | Changes ripple through dependents | Who calls this? Are they updated? |

**Time allocation:** 40% compatibility, 25% consumer impact, 20% documentation, 15% versioning

## Review Process

```dot
digraph review_process {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    start [label="PR Received" shape=ellipse];
    context [label="1. Gather Context\n(description, ticket, scope)"];
    change_type [label="2. Identify Change Type\n(feature/bugfix/refactor)" shape=diamond];
    security_scan [label="3. Security Quick Scan\n(4 critical items)" style=filled fillcolor="#ffcccc"];
    critical_dim [label="4. Critical Dimensions\n(Correctness, Tests)" style=filled fillcolor="#ffcccc"];
    high_dim [label="5. High Dimensions\n(Architecture, Quality)"];
    medium_dim [label="6. Medium/Low Dimensions\n(Performance, A11y, Docs)"];
    devils_advocate [label="7. Devil's Advocate\n(What could go wrong?)"];
    impact_radius [label="8. Impact Radius\n(Dependencies, contracts)"];
    decision [label="9. Make Decision" shape=diamond];
    approve [label="Approve" style=filled fillcolor="#ccffcc"];
    request_changes [label="Request Changes" style=filled fillcolor="#ffcccc"];

    start -> context;
    context -> change_type;
    change_type -> security_scan;
    security_scan -> critical_dim;
    critical_dim -> high_dim;
    high_dim -> medium_dim;

    devils_advocate -> impact_radius;
    impact_radius -> decision;
    decision -> approve [label="No Critical/High"];
    decision -> request_changes [label="Critical/High found"];
}
```

**Key:** Red boxes = mandatory, never skip.

## Security Quick Scan

**Always run. Takes ~2 minutes. Catches 80% of critical security issues.**

| ID | Check | Detection Pattern |
|----|-------|-------------------|
| SEC-001 | No hardcoded secrets | Search: `password=`, `apiKey=`, `token=`, `secret=` |
| SEC-002 | SQL injection prevented | Look for string concatenation in queries |
| SEC-003 | Auth on protected routes | New routes have auth middleware |
| SEC-004 | Authorization checks | Resource access verifies ownership |

**If ANY fail → STOP. Request changes immediately.**

### Risk Signals (Trigger Deep Review)

- New/modified authentication code
- Database query changes
- User input handling changes
- File upload functionality
- External API integrations
- Cryptographic operations
- Permission/authorization changes
- New API endpoints

## Accessibility Quick Scan

**Run for UI changes. Takes ~2 minutes. Catches common A11Y barriers.**

| ID | Check | Detection Pattern |
|----|-------|-------------------|
| A11Y-001 | Semantic HTML used | Search: `<div onClick=`, `<span onClick=` (should be buttons) |
| A11Y-002 | Keyboard accessible | onClick handlers without onKeyDown/onKeyPress |
| A11Y-004 | Form inputs have labels | `<input>` without associated label or aria-label |
| A11Y-006 | Focus management correct | tabIndex manipulation, focus traps in modals |

**If ANY fail in user-facing UI → Request changes.**

### UI Change Signals (Trigger A11Y Review)

- New UI components or pages
- Modal/dialog implementations
- Form additions or changes
- Interactive element changes (buttons, links, menus)
- Navigation structure changes
- Custom widget implementations

## Devil's Advocate Analysis

**Mandatory section. Challenge the implementation.**

### Questions to Ask

1. **What could go wrong in production?**
   - Under high load?
   - With unexpected input?
   - With network failures?

2. **What assumptions might be wrong?**
   - Data format assumptions?
   - Timing assumptions?
   - State assumptions?

3. **What edge cases are unhandled?**
   - Empty collections?
   - Null/undefined values?
   - Concurrent modifications?
   - Partial failures?

4. **What happens when dependencies fail?**
   - External API down?
   - Database connection lost?
   - Cache miss?

## Impact Radius Analysis

### Direct Dependencies

| Question | How to Check |
|----------|--------------|
| What imports this file? | `grep -r "import.*from.*<file>"` |
| What calls this function? | Find references in IDE |
| What extends this class? | Search for `extends <class>` |

### Contract Changes

| Change Type | Breaking? | Action |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Removed export | Yes | Find all usages, update |
| Changed parameter | Likely | Check all callers |
| Narrowed return type | Likely | Verify consumers handle |
| Added required field | Yes | Update all creators |
| Changed behavior | Maybe | Verify tests cover |

### Side Effect Checklist

- [ ] Changed types remain compatible with all usages?
- [ ] Existing callers' expected behavior still works?
- [ ] Affected code paths covered by tests?
- [ ] New failure cases handled by callers?
- [ ] State changes propagate correctly?
- [ ] Async chains still valid?

## Refactoring Verification

**For refactoring PRs: Tests passing ≠ Bug-free. Manual verification required.**

| Area | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Conditional branches** | Does each if/else/switch branch work as intended? |
| **Data transformations** | Do all fields map correctly? |
| **Optional handling** | Do `?.`, `??`, `\|\|` provide intended fallbacks? |
| **Dependency injection** | Are all dependencies properly wired? |
| **Edge cases** | Null, undefined, empty array handled? |

**Output format:**
- 🔴 `file.ts:42` - [issue]: Missing null check on user.address
- ✅ Conditional branches: Verified all cases covered

## Anti-Sycophancy Guide

### Prohibited Phrases

| Don't Say | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| "Great job" | Subjective praise |
| "Well done" | Subjective praise |
| "Excellent work" | Subjective praise |
| "Looks good to me" (without evidence) | Empty approval |
| "LGTM" (without review) | Rubber stamp |

### Required Language

| Instead Of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "Great error handling" | "Error handling covers: network failures, validation errors, timeouts" |
| "Nice architecture" | "Architecture follows layer separation: API → Service → Repository" |
| "Good tests" | "Tests cover: happy path, 3 edge cases, 2 error conditions" |

### Evidence-Based Format

Every observation must include:
- **Location**: `file.ts:line`
- **Finding**: What you observed
- **Impact**: Why it matters (or doesn't)

## Constructive Feedback Patterns

Anti-sycophancy prevents false praise. This section ensures feedback that's both honest AND helpful.

**Note:** Brief suggestions are fine ("Consider using X"). Avoid rewriting entire implementations in comments—that's doing their work for them (see Efficiency Anti-Patterns).

### Feedback Tone Spectrum

| Tone | Example | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Blocking** | "This will cause data loss. Must fix before merge." | Critical issues, security, data integrity |
| **Requesting** | "Please add null check here—crash possible." | High issues requiring change |
| **Suggesting** | "Consider extracting this to a helper—readability." | Medium issues, optional improvements |
| **Noting** | "FYI: Similar pattern in utils/helpers.ts" | Knowledge sharing, not requiring change |
| **Questioning** | "What happens if X is empty? I might be missing context." | Uncertain findings, seeking clarification |

### Constructive Phrasing

| Instead Of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "This is wrong" | "This will cause [specific problem] because [reason]" |
| "Why did you do this?" | "What was the reasoning for [approach]? I want to understand the context." |
| "This doesn't make sense" | "I'm having trouble following [specific part]. Could you add a comment?" |
| "You should have..." | "For future reference, [pattern] helps with [benefit]" |
| "Obviously..." | Remove. If it were obvious, it wouldn't need saying. |
| "Just do X" | "One option: [X]. This would [benefit]." |

### Mentoring Through Reviews

**For junior developers:**
- Explain the "why" behind requests, not just the "what"
- Link to documentation, patterns, or prior PRs as examples
- Distinguish blocking issues from learning opportunities
- Acknowledge good decisions explicitly (with evidence, per anti-sycophancy)

**For senior developers:**
- Be direct—they don't need hand-holding
- Focus on architectural concerns over style
- Ask questions about design decisions you don't understand
- Trust their judgment on implementation details

### Disagreement Protocol

When author pushes back on feedback:

1. **Re-read your comment** — Is it clear? Is the impact obvious?
2. **Provide evidence** — Code, docs, benchmarks, not opinions
3. **Acknowledge tradeoffs** — "Your approach is faster to implement, mine is more maintainable"
4. **Escalate appropriately** — Tech lead for architecture, security team for vulnerabilities
5. **Accept disagreement** — Not every hill is worth dying on. Document and move on.

**Never:** Make it personal. Attack the code, not the coder.

## Output Format

**Section order is mandatory. Critique-first.**

```markdown
## PR Review: [PR Title]

### 1. Context
- Change type: [feature/bugfix/refactor]
- Scope: [X files, Y lines added, Z removed]
- Linked: [ticket/issue]

### 2. Critical Findings
| Issue | Location | Impact | Severity |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| [finding] | file:line | [impact] | Critical/High |

### 3. Security Quick Scan
- [x] No hardcoded secrets
- [x] SQL injection prevented
- [ ] Auth on protected routes - MISSING on `/api/users`
- [x] Authorization checks

### 4. Devil's Advocate
- **Risk**: [what could go wrong]
- **Assumption**: [what might be wrong]
- **Edge case**: [unhandled scenario]

### 5. Impact Radius
- Direct dependencies: [list]
- Contract changes: [breaking/non-breaking]

### 6. Dimension Review
[Per-dimension findings with file:line references]

### 7. Decision
**Request Changes** / **Approve** / **Approve with Comments**

Reason: [evidence-based justification]
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "This change is too simple" | Simple changes break things too. Checklist takes 2 min. |
| "The tests pass" | Tests verify author's assumptions. Review catches flawed assumptions. |
| "I trust this developer" | Trust ≠ verification. Everyone makes mistakes. |
| "Security isn't my expertise" | Basic checklist doesn't require expertise. Follow it. |
| "Accessibility is nice-to-have" | Accessibility is a requirement. It's in the checklist. |
| "I'll do quick now, thorough later" | 'Later' never comes. Approved code ships. |
| "The PR is too large" | Large PR = high risk. Request smaller PRs or more time. |
| "It's just a hotfix" | Hotfixes become permanent. Technical debt accrues interest. |
| "Already reviewed similar code" | Context matters. This PR has different state. |
| "Internal tooling, doesn't matter" | Internal tools become external. Bad patterns spread. |
| "Generated code is safe" | Generated code can have bad templates. Review it. |
| "Just dependency updates" | Dependencies are code you didn't write. Security review MORE important. |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, **STOP and return to checklist**:

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Skip the security check, it's internal"
- "The author said they tested it"
- "It's probably fine"
- "I don't understand but it looks okay"
- "One more approval won't hurt"
- "Everyone else approved it"
- "We're behind schedule"
- "It's been open too long"

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to checklist. Complete all Critical dimensions.**

## When Stuck

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| PR too large | Request smaller PRs. If urgent, review in chunks by component. |
| Unfamiliar domain | Ask author for context. Review related PRs. Check docs/ADRs. |
| Conflicting requirements | Escalate to product owner. Document assumptions in review. |
| Time pressure | Complete Critical dimensions ONLY. Note skipped areas explicitly. |
| Author pushback | Focus on objective evidence. Reference standards/checklist IDs. |
| Can't reproduce issue | Request reproduction steps. Check environment differences. |
| Uncertain about impact | Use Impact Radius Analysis. When in doubt, request changes. |
| Missing context | Check linked ticket/issue. Ask author before assuming. |

**If still stuck:** Escalate to specialist (see Specialist Escalation section).

## Verification Checklist

Before submitting your review:

- [ ] Security Quick Scan completed (4 items)
- [ ] Correctness dimension reviewed
- [ ] Test coverage dimension reviewed
- [ ] Devil's Advocate analysis completed
- [ ] Impact Radius assessed
- [ ] No prohibited phrases in feedback
- [ ] All findings include file:line references

**Cannot check all boxes? Do not submit approval.**

## Knowledge Sharing

Reviews are learning opportunities. Capture and propagate valuable patterns.

### What to Capture

| Discovery | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Reusable pattern found | Add to team's pattern library or wiki |
| Common mistake identified | Create linting rule or add to onboarding docs |
| Unclear API discovered | Request/add documentation in that PR |
| Performance insight gained | Share in team channel with benchmark |
| Security vulnerability pattern | Add to security checklist, alert security team |

### How to Share

**In the PR itself:**
- Tag team members who'd benefit: "FYI @alice - this pattern solves the issue you hit last week"
- Add explanatory comments for non-obvious code
- Link to relevant ADRs, RFCs, or documentation

**Beyond the PR:**
- Post noteworthy patterns in team Slack/channel with context
- Update team wiki with new patterns discovered
- Propose linting rules for recurring issues
- Add to interview question bank if it reveals important concepts

### Learning from Reviews

**After each review, ask:**
- Did I learn something new about the codebase?
- Did I learn something new about the domain?
- Did I see a pattern I should adopt?
- Did I see a mistake I've made before?

**Track your own growth:**
- Keep a "TIL" (Today I Learned) log from reviews
- Note patterns you want to adopt in your own code
- Revisit your old PRs after learning new patterns

## Review Metrics

Measure review effectiveness to improve the process.

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Review turnaround** | Time from "Ready" to first review | < 4 hours |
| **Review cycles** | Number of review → change → review loops | ≤ 2 |
| **Escapees** | Bugs found in prod that reviews missed | 0 |
| **False positives** | Requested changes that weren't actually issues | < 10% |
| **Review coverage** | PRs merged without review | 0% |

### Issue Categorization

Tag findings for pattern analysis:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| `security` | Auth bypass, injection, secrets |
| `correctness` | Logic errors, missing cases |
| `performance` | N+1, memory leaks, blocking |
| `maintainability` | Complexity, duplication, naming |
| `testing` | Missing tests, flaky tests |
| `documentation` | Missing/outdated docs |

### Using Metrics

**Weekly:**
- Review turnaround times — Are PRs waiting too long?
- Cycle counts — Are requirements unclear? Are reviewers too picky?

**Monthly:**
- Escapee analysis — What did we miss? Why?
- Category trends — Are certain issue types increasing?

**Quarterly:**
- Process retrospective — Is our review process effective?
- Training needs — Do specific categories need team education?

**Don't:**
- Use metrics punitively (reviewer found issues = good, not bad)
- Optimize for speed over quality
- Compare reviewers to each other

### Tooling {#review-tooling}

| Platform | Metric Source | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **GitHub** | Insights → Pulse | Review activity, cycle time |
| **GitHub** | GraphQL API | Custom queries for turnaround |
| **GitLab** | Analytics → Code Review | Built-in review metrics |
| **Bitbucket** | Reports → Commits | PR activity tracking |
| **Third-party** | LinearB, Sleuth, Haystack | Cross-platform analytics |

**CLI quick checks:**
```bash
# GitHub: Recent PR review times (requires gh CLI)
gh pr list --state merged --json number,mergedAt,createdAt --limit 20

# Git: Author-reviewer pairs (local analysis)
git log --format='%an reviewed by %cn' --merges --since='1 month ago'
```
