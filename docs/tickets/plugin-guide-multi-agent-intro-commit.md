docs(plugin-guide): add multi-agent philosophy intro to all languages

Add 29 specialized agents value proposition intro to plugin-guide.md
files across all 5 supported languages (en, ko, ja, zh-CN, es).

This aligns plugin documentation with the recently updated README,
philosophy.md, and getting-started.md files that now consistently
communicate the multi-agent collaboration messaging.

Changes:
- Add intro line immediately after title in each file
- Use consistent "29 specialized agents" count
- Include PLAN → ACT → EVAL workflow reference
- Match established messaging pattern from getting-started.md
